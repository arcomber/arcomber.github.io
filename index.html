    <h1>Master the C++ standard library to make your code faster, more robust and maintainable</h1>
    <p>Look at many C++ code bases, and you will see a lot of code that looks a lot like C.  Loads of for loops, while loops, massively nested if statements.  It is hard to read and hard to maintain.  And a lot of it can be replaced with standard library algorithms that will work better, faster and not be so sore on your eyes.  See this video for more on this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2tWOdzgXHA">No raw loops</a></p>
    <p>But changing the way we work from writing imperative loops which describe how to solve the problem to a more declarative way of writing code takes some practice. And it requires knowledge of the many standard library algorithms that will replace these loops</p>
    <p>The purpose of this course is to change our habits by problem solving.  This is a very practical approach and can make the learning process much more enjoyable</p>
    <p>To proceed, work your way through the problems, where you convert code which descibes the way a computer solves the problem, often many lines of code, with much fewer, usually one liners that use the standard library</p>
